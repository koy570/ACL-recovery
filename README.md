Functional Resistance Training to Improve Knee Function After ACL Reconstruction

**Improving ACL Reconstruction Outcomes with Functional Resistance Training**  

ü¶µ **Key Insights from Clinical Study (NCT03282565):**  
Functional resistance training can significantly improve post-ACL surgery recovery, enhancing muscle strength and knee symmetry.  

üìä **Top Findings**:  
1. **Quadriceps Muscle Strength**:  
   - Participants using **brace-based resistance training** showed the greatest improvement (+0.674 Nm/kg).  
   - Elastic bands also helped, but with moderate gains (+0.398 Nm/kg).  
2. **Knee Flexion Symmetry**:  
   - Brace training led to a **3.23¬∞ improvement**, far exceeding the other methods.  

üéØ **Why This Matters**:  
This study highlights the importance of **task-specific resistance exercises** post-ACL reconstruction to optimize muscle strength and knee functionality, leading to better patient recovery.

**Visualizations**:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Change in Quadriceps Muscle Strength**:  
- A bar chart comparing strength improvements across three groups: brace-based training, elastic bands, and a control group.  
- **Observation**: Brace-based resistance training yielded the highest strength gains, followed by elastic bands, with minimal progress in the control group.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Knee Flexion Angle Symmetry**:  
- A bar chart illustrating improvements in knee flexion symmetry post-intervention.  
- **Finding**: Brace training improved symmetry significantly (+3.23¬∞), whereas elastic bands and controls showed negligible changes.

üîë **Takeaway**:  
Task-specific resistance training using braces post-ACL reconstruction can optimize outcomes, making it a promising approach for rehab programs.
